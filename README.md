# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose for the Prework Study Guide Webpage is to compile all information learned in the bootcamp prework assignments into organized notes for future reference.
I built this project so that I can use this source as a way to take notes and to track my learning throughout the bootcamp.
This solves the problem of needing to go to different sources for information; I can store my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in one place for easy access.
I learned the basic fundamentals of what HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are, and hope to continue building on these concepts as I continue to learn more about web design.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to not only review the basic fundamendals I learned for each topic (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript) in the bootcamp prework assignment, but to also allow me the opportunity to keep documenting my notes and learned knowledge of these concepts. The Prework Study Guide is divided into sections for each of the topics, and while they are different, they are all equally important in constructing a web page. In addition, when we open up the Chrome DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running and view changes we make to it in real time. The console lists the topics we learned from prework and from how I configured it, chooses one topic for me to study first.
