          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The head element and body element are parent elements. The parent elements hold the child elements.</li>
          <li>The elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>To code elements, they need to have opening and closing tags.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model: Every HTML element is a box. Everything in CSS has a box around it. Margin>Border>Padding>Content.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Style directly in the HTML file. Useful for quick and permanent changes, but less flexible. Each inline style must be edited individially when you make a design change. Use style attribute in HTML.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet: Embed sheet in HTML using style element in head. The rules will only apply to that page. A single change to CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.
          </li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet: Preferred method to CSS, keeps all CSS rules in separate file. Once completed, you link the file using a link element in the head element.</li>
          <li>CSS can be applied to text and images.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control software. It lets you manage and track your version controls locally, where you then upload into GitHub, a cloud hosting service.</li>
          <li>When coding git: always start the command line with "git".</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch called branch-name and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b feature/branch-name: create a new feature branch called branch-name.</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switch to your main branch.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls down the latest main branch from GitHub repo. Always do a git pull so that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer. Use this to also sync our local branch with the remote branch in GitHub.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/branch-name: Once confirmed that our local and remote branch are in synch, push changes we made locally to our remote GitHub branch. You can view the new feature branch on GitHub.</li>
          <li>git add -A:Add the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git. We use add -A command to commit all files in the working branch. Once all changes have been staged, we can commit them to our repo.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file": Use this to commit the changes. The -m flag associates a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short description of the changes implemented.</li>
